# Hermione Granger - Presentation Script

---

## Slide 1 — Title Slide

"Hi everyone! My name is Alae, and today I'm going to talk about my favorite character from Harry Potter - Hermione Granger, the Brightest Witch of Her Age. I picked her because she's an amazing character that I think we can all learn something from. Let me tell you why!"

## Slide 2 — Meet Hermione!

"So first, let me introduce her. Hermione Granger is one of the main characters in Harry Potter. She's best friends with Harry and Ron, and she's known for being incredibly smart and brave. She's the kind of friend who would do anything to help the people she cares about."

"What I find really inspiring about her is that she was born to non-magical parents - she's what they call Muggle-born. She didn't grow up knowing anything about magic. But instead of letting that hold her back, she worked harder than anyone else and became the smartest witch in her entire year at Hogwarts. That's pretty incredible if you think about it."

> **Press ↓**

"And that's one of the first things Hermione teaches us - it really doesn't matter where you start in life. What matters is how hard you're willing to try. I think that's a lesson all of us can relate to."

## Slide 3 — Early Years at Hogwarts

"When Hermione first arrived at Hogwarts, she was a bit different from the other kids. I think a lot of us can relate to that feeling - you know, being the new kid, wanting to prove yourself, but not quite fitting in. That's exactly how Hermione felt at first."

"But even back then, she was already special. She took risks to help Harry and showed real wisdom when it mattered. She didn't like fighting or arguing, and okay - she could be a little bossy sometimes. But honestly? That's just because she always knew what needed to be done and she wasn't afraid to speak up. I think that takes a lot of courage."

"So what Hermione shows us here is that being different isn't a bad thing - it can actually be your biggest strength. And I think that's really important to remember."

## Slide 4 — What Makes Hermione Special?

"Now let me tell you what makes Hermione truly special. She's brave, smart, and full of courage. She knows all the spells and potions because she actually pays attention in every single class - unlike some of her friends! And she's got these amazing detective skills. She's always the one giving clues to Harry and Ron and figuring out mysteries before anyone else can."

> **Press ↓**

"But here's the thing - she's not perfect. And that's actually what makes her so great. She can get angry and intense, and sometimes she's confused about what to do. She really doesn't like violence or cruelty because she has a genuinely good heart. And when things got really dangerous? She was scared too - just like any of us would be. She's human, and that's what makes her feel real."

> **Press ↓**

"And that's another big lesson from Hermione - you don't have to be perfect to be extraordinary. You just have to be yourself. I really love that about her."

## Slide 5 — Growing Up & Getting Stronger

"One of my favorite things about Hermione is how much she grows throughout the story. As she got older, she changed and became so much stronger. Her whole journey through Hogwarts really transformed her."

> **Press ↓**

"She started out scared and without any friends. Then slowly, she became happier as she found where she belonged. And by the end, she had grown into this loyal, smart, and caring person that everyone could count on. She went from having nobody to being the person everyone needed."

> **Press ↓**

"Growing up is all about becoming who you're meant to be. And that's exactly what Hermione did. I think her story shows us that it's okay to not have everything figured out right away - you'll get there."

## Slide 6 — Why I Chose Hermione

"So why did I choose Hermione as my favorite character? Because she shows us that what really matters in life isn't magic or coming from a special family. It's about having the courage and the heart to do what's right, even when it's hard."

> **Press ↓**

"Yes, she's the smartest witch and she knows everything about spells and potions. But what I love most about her is that she's filled with joy, love, and care. She makes everyone around her better just by being herself. And honestly? That's the kind of person I want to be like."

> **Press ↓**

"And that's why Hermione Granger is my absolute favorite character. Not just in Harry Potter - but in any story I've ever read."

## Slide 7 — The Lesson

"I want to leave you all with this thought. The Harry Potter story teaches us something really beautiful - it doesn't matter where you come from or what family you were born into. What matters is who you choose to be. Hermione proved that every single day. And I think we can all try to do the same."

*Pause, then:*

"Thank you for listening!"

> **That's the end! Great job!**
